The ovary is a crucial gonadal organ in women, primarily responsible for ovulation and the secretion of female hormones. Ovarian tumors are common tumors within the female reproductive system. Due to the ovaries being located deep within the pelvic cavity, these tumors are often difficult to detect early. Ovarian tumors can be classified into different types, including endometriomas, serous ovarian cysts, mucinous ovarian cysts, and malignant ovarian tumors.
Current methods for diagnosing ovarian cancer include transvaginal ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and blood tests (CA-125). The severity of the condition is assessed based on the size of the ovarian cancer lesion and whether the tumor has metastasized to other parts of the body. Physicians then predict the likelihood of complete tumor removal post-surgery to decide whether to proceed with surgery.
Due to individual differences among patients, varying tumor growth rates, and differences in physicians' judgments based on their experience, there is no standardized method for assessment. This study uses CT images from patients as training data. A total of 7,294 images from 107 patients were collected and divided into training and testing sets in a 9:1 ratio, with 20% of the training set further used as a validation set. The training set consists of 77 patients with 5,247 images, the validation set includes 19 patients with 1,295 images, and the testing set includes 11 patients with 4,512 images.
In this study, a deep learning model was trained using CT images with the aim of segmenting organ regions in the images to improve tumor identification within these organs. The segmented regions predicted by the model were then input into the next stage of the model to detect the corresponding tumors. The accuracy rates achieved were approximately 0.82 for the liver region, 0.65 for the lymph node region, and 0.61 for the pelvic region. By predicting the locations of the regions first and then performing tumor segmentation, the segmentation accuracy for liver tumors increased from 0.71 to 0.78, for lymph node tumors from 0.52 to 0.61, and for ovarian tumors from 0.79 to 0.84. The model's predictions can assist physicians in making clinical decisions regarding the necessity of tumor removal surgery.

The training data consisted of continuous CT images from the chest to the abdomen of 107 patients, totaling 7,294 CT images. After data augmentation, the total number of CT images increased to 43,764. Since consecutive CT slices from the same patient are highly correlated, the data had to be divided by patient, as shown in Figure 3-3. The 107 patients were first divided into training and testing datasets in a 9:1 ratio, and then the training data was further split into a training set and a validation set in an 8:2 ratio. Table 3-2 shows the number of images for each organ region in the different datasets after allocation. The training set contains data from 77 patients, with 5,247 CT images, increasing to 31,482 after data augmentation. The validation set contains data from 19 patients, with 1,295 CT images, increasing to 7,770 after augmentation. The test set contains data from 11 patients, with 4,512 CT images.

The original image data is first labeled, followed by preprocessing steps such as denoising and normalization. The dataset is then divided into training, validation, and testing sets. After the data allocation is completed, data augmentation is applied to the datasets. The augmented training and validation datasets are then used to train the model. Finally, the trained model is used to predict the test set data, and its prediction accuracy is evaluated.
